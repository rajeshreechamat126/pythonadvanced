Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of the         object. A Function is independent, whereas a method is a function liked with an object. Explicit data is passed on to a         function, whears a method completely passes the object on which it was called in the program.

    "Ans:\n",
    "     Reflection refers to the ability for code to be able to examine attributes about objects that might be passed as                parameters to a function. For example, if we write type(obj) then Python will return an object which represents the type        of obj. Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other          sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str        type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string. In other words, writing str() is the        same thing as writing “”. Likewise, writing list() is the same thing as writing [].\n"
