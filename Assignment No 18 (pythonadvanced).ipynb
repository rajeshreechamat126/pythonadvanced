    "     Text files are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable charactetrs as a rich text document or      plain text doument. Text files also store data in aequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters. where          Binary files are those typical files that store data in the from of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes      sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc)      under a single file.\n",

    "Que2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead       of text files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "     Text files are less prone to get corrupted as any undesired change may just show up once the file is opend and then can        easily be removed whareas binary files can be used instead of text files for image data/video/audio. For many types of          data, binary representations are such more spance-efficient. For instance, you could represent an images as a text file.        But any color represented as a 24-bit RGB value in a binary file has to be represented as a six-character code \n",
    "     (e.g. FFFFFF for white) in text, which is literally twice as many bits. Anothe reason for using binary formats is that          they can map directly onto the internal representation of the data that the program is using. If my program uses a complex      data structure that's full of integer, float, and byte values, when I read it in from  a text file i have to parse every        character of text and interpret it, spending processing time (and writiong logic) to figure how to converrt the 88 bits in      \"2983102931\", into the 32-bit integer that the text represents. If I read from a binary file, the program just copies          those 32 bits from the file into memory.\n",

Thereby not leaving a file in open mode and also there would no need to explicitly close a file.        Using with means that the file will be closed as soon as you leave the block.

In other words, it's process of converting a Python object into a bytes stream to      store it in a file/database, maintain program state across sessions, or transport data over the network. The pickled bytes      steram can be used to re-create the original object hierarchy bt unpickling the stream. This whole process is similar to        object serialization in java or.Net.\n",
